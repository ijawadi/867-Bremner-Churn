# 867-Bremner-Churn

Executive Summary:
Customer churn, defined as “the customer movement from one provider to another”, is a major problem and one of the most important concerns for large companies. Due to the direct effect on the revenues of the companies, especially in the telecom field, companies are seeking to develop means to predict potential customer to churn.

The churn rate measures a company's loss in subscribers for a given period of time.  It is mostly expressed as the percentage of service subscribers who discontinue their subscriptions within a given period. 

The telecom industry is highly competitive, making it easy for customers to switch from one provider to another. The churn rate has a material impact on the bottom line so much that analysts focus on churn rate and cost in it is discussed in quarterly or annual results.   Since the cost of acquiring new customers is much higher than to retain current customers, it makes sense to invest in a process to predict churn and provide incentives to prevent customers before they leave.

Team Bremner has been hired to explore the customer dataset with over 7,000 unique observations and 21 features.  The data contains a flag that identifies whether a customer churned.  Bremner is tasked to use the data and a model that can successfully identifies customer churn.  



Background
Telco’s current status quo and customer churn:
The telecommunications sector has become one of the main industries where churn causes material impact on the bottom line. The rapid technical advancement, ever dropping cost of telecom equipment combined with regulators concern about monopoly,  leaves large telecoms unable to acquire or merge.  These factors have lowered the barriers to entries where new start-ups sprung and grab market share in profitable areas like mobile by attracting customers from densely populated areas, and steer away from capital intensive offerings like wired-phones or cable.  The star-ups also benefited from regulations by tapping into large telecom’s bandwidth in rural areas at a low price and reselling it at a higher margin.

The large telecom companies are dealing with several factors that they have little power to control, and these factors squeeze their bottom line:
-	Regulation: 
o	The heavy hand of regulation mandates to provide access to sparely populated, rural areas, which requires heavy, long term investment with low returns.
o	Provide bandwidth access to smaller telecom companies at a low rate.  This helps smaller provides to compete in rural areas with little capital investment
o	Large companies are also heavily securitized if acquire or merge opportunities arise.
-	Customers:
o	Customers become more tech-savvy and continuously shop around for better price
o	Dissatisfied customers increasingly use the power of media to voice their opinion and even sue giant telecoms
-	Marketing:
o	Marketing is no longer one way, from provide to consumer.
o	Social media and on-line reviews have enabled customers to shift the balance from providers to consumer 
-	Manufacture Partnership:
o	iPhone arguably changed the carriers and phone maker’s relationship forever, not in favor of telecoms.  The iPhone became such a hit with consumers, who lined up and camped out for days to buy it, that it tipped the balance of power. Manufacturers like Apple could now set tougher terms and demand more concessions from carriers.



So in this hyper competitive market, customer churn is a game changer and companies are working hard to survive in this competitive market.  
There are three main strategies around customers proposed to generate more revenues:
1.	Acquire new customers, 
2.	Upsell the existing customers, and
3.	Increase the retention period of customers. 

In comparing these strategies taking the value of return on investment (ROI) for each strategy  has shown that the third strategy is the most profitable strategy.  Addressing churn and retaining an existing customer cost is much lower than acquiring a new one 

The status quo has been to implement the second strategy, by bundling products.  This practice initially succeeded but it is proven to be much harder than increasing the retention:
-	Bundling maybe harmful to consumers as it reduces transparency, and this affects the subscriber’s ability to compare products and prices offered by other providers 
-	Consumers do not use all bundled products and feel cheated paying the bill for bundled products that they have no say in selecting 
-	Bundled products increases monthly bill and these customers become a prime target for competition 

So customer retention is much easier than the upselling strategy and predicting the customers who are likely to leave the company and retaining those customers has the potential to generate significantly higher revenue.  
There are several issues need to be carefully considered in order to address customer churn.
-	Predict customers that may churn 
-	Prediction needs to happen in the early phase
-	Provide a proper incentive 

The prediction:
The prediction requires predictive analytics and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are highly effective in addressing this issue. The algorithm requires timely, comprehensive, and relevant data including customer information, location, satisfaction survey, tenure and contractual agreements.  The data should be analyzed to exclude uncontrollable churn reasons like moving to different location, marriage breakdown and death.

Timeliness:
The prediction needs to happen in early phase and a retention remedy need to be applied  proactively.  The tatus quo has been to convince customer who call in to terminate subscription.  This remedy is not effective.  By the time a customer calls in, he/she has already signed a contract with another provider.  To proactively call a customer based on the prediction model and offer incentives, could be costly if the model has a high false positive rate, meaning the model predicts customers churn who are not planning to leave.  To address this, the model need to be trained with up-to-date data on a regular bases and service staff, who call customers should be trained to validate prediction’s correctness as they speak with the customer before they offer incentives.  Details of the conversation need to be captured and fed into the model for better results.

Incentives:
Incentives are varied based on customer’s tenure, life-time value, and potential review.  Incentives could be discounts, special offers or gratification services
